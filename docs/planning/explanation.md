In all honesty, I envision this project as something I will send my parents and they will love.
I have bonded a lot with both of my parents over our shared love for "oldies", whether it be
through them recollecting their favorites or me "discovering" a song that brings back memories
for them.

During high school, I realized most of my friends really did not know much about the music I was
so passionate about (besides a few Beatles fanatics) yet they absolutely loved when I showed them
my favorite songs. Above that, I often found remixes of some of my favorites on platforms like
SoundCloud and these were enjoyed by the biggest music-critics of my friends.

I feel as though "Oldies" get a bad name, particularly by being bar and wedding songs that are
overplayed (wink wink, Piano Man and Shout--the ultimate wedding songs). There are so many amazing
songs and artists that I wouldn't know if it were not for my parents--artists like Boy George, the
Cure, Blondie, Talking Heads--and my friends wouldn't know if not for me.

I want to provide a platform (even though it probably will only ever be seen by classmates, friends,
  and family) that expresses my passion for oldies and makes them even more interesting than I already
  find them. I am choosing some of my favorite artists, providing some of the most interesting facts
  about them, adding some of my favorite original songs, and then providing remixes and covers that I
  think people in my generation and future ones will be able to appreciate.

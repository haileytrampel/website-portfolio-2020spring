    <h1>Keeping the Oldies Young</h1>

    <h2>What does it mean?</h2>

    <p>For decades, music of the generations before us have been
    termed <strong>"oldies"</strong>. Today, some of the most legendary
    music has been lost, covered by the technology and autotune
    of today's artists. As Ziggy Marley said, <em>"Old music used to
    mean something. There is none of that today"</em>. </p>

    <p>Growing up surrounded by some of the most amazing music of
      my parents' time, it has strongly influenced how I look
      at music. For that reason, I want to share some of the songs
      that remain my favorites today, as well as some of the
      recreations modern artists have made of those very songs. </p>

    <h1>The Legends Behind the Songs</h1>

    <h2>The Story is What Makes the Song.</h2>
  </div>
    <p>One of the most shaking things about old music is the personas
      they have taken on over the years, many of which are shockingly off-kilter.
      One of the most blatantly wrong, yet popular, interpretations of a song is
      that of Blondie's hit track "One Way or Another". Many take it as a determined
      person singing of how they will accomplish their dreams no matter the obstacles.
      Quite inspirational, right? <strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

      <p>The reason I love the version included on this page is because of how
        hauntingly accurate it is to the stories true meaning. Lead Singer Debbie
        Harry is singing of true events, but not about 'chasing your dreams'. The
        song is a lyrical masterpiece capturing the determination of her ex-boyfriend,
        who stalked her for years after their split. He would show up, drunk, and stand
        outside her door. He made it clear to her that nothing would deter him. This
        obviously clashes with the band's upbeat production of the song, which is why stories
        behind songs can be so vital to appreciating the piece and is something that makes
        oldies so special. How many masterpieces can you name in modern music with a meaning
        as wildly misinterpreted as this?</p>
